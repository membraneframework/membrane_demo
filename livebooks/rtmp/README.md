# Membrane RMTP demo

Sender livebook shows how to download video and audio from the web using the `Hackney` plugin, and stream it via `RTMP` to the other, receiver livebook.

Receiver livebook shows how to receive `RTMP` stream mentioned above and play it in the livebook.

To run the demo, [install Livebook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook#escript) and open both `rtmp_sender.livemd` and `rtmp_sender.livemd` files there.
