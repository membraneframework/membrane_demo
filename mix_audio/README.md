# Membrane Demo - Mix Audio

This script demonstrates mixing two audio tracks

To run the demo, you need [Elixir installed](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) on your machine (it's best to use a version manager, like `asdf`). Then, run

```bash
elixir mix_audio.exs
```

and it will generate `output.aac`, that you can play with VLC or other player.

Should there be any errors when compiling the script's dependencies, you may need to install [FDK AAC](https://github.com/mstorsjo/fdk-aac), which we use to encode the output stream.
