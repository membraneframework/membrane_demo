# Membrane Demo - RTP

This project demonstrates handling RTP in Membrane.

This example uses [RTP plugin](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_rtp_plugin) that is responsible for
receiving and sending RTP streams.

## Prerequisites

You have to have installed the following packages on your system:

* FFmpeg 4.x
* SDL 2
* PortAudio

One-liner for Ubuntu:
```bash
apt install ffmpeg portaudio19-dev libsdl2-dev
```
One-liner for MacOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg portaudio sdl2
```

Then, install mix dependencies:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

## Run the demo

* Open a terminal in the project directory
* Type `mix run --no-halt receive.exs`
* Open another terminal in the project directory
* Type: `mix run --no-halt send.exs`

You should be able to see an SDL player showing an example video.

The sender pipeline (run with `send.exs`) takes sample audio and video files 
and sends them with RTP.
The receiving pipeline (run with `receive.exs`) depayloads the audio and video streams and plays them.


If you wish to stream using SRTP, add `--secure` flag when running both `receive.exs` and `send.exs`.

Alternatively, the stream can be sent using [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). In this case, you only need to start the receiving pipeline:

```bash
mix run --no-halt receive.exs
```

and launch gstreamer:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v audiotestsrc ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! opusenc ! rtpopuspay pt=120 ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5002\
    videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=I420 ! x264enc key-int-max=10 tune=zerolatency ! rtph264pay pt=96 ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5000
```
