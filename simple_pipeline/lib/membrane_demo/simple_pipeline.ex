  @doc """
  In order to play `.mp3` file we need to read it first.

  In membrane every entry point to data flow is called `Source`. Since we want
  to play a `file`, we will use `File.Source`.

  Next problem that arises is the fact that we are reading MPEG Layer 3 frames
  not raw audio. To deal with that we need to use `Filter` called decoder. It
  takes `.mp3` frames and yields RAW audio data.

  There is one tiny problem here though. Decoder returns `%Raw{format: :s24le}`
  data, but PortAudio (module that actually talks with the audio driver of your
  computer) wants `%Raw{format: :s16le, sample_rate: 48000, channels: 2}`.

  That's where `SWResample.Converter` comes into play. It will consume data that
  doesn't suite our needs and will yield data in format we want.
