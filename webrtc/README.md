# WebRTC Examples

This directory contains various WebRTC examples.
The structure is as follows.

* auth - an example of signaling server with authentication based on [Membrane.WebRTC.Server](https://github.com/membraneframework/webrtc-server.git)
* simple - simple example of signaling server based on [Membrane.WebRTC.Server](https://github.com/membraneframework/webrtc-server.git)
* videoroom - basic example of [Membrane SFU API](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_sfu.git). 
It's as simple as possible just to show you how to use our API.
* videoroom_advanced - a little more advanced example of [Membrane SFU API](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_sfu.git) that we deploy under https://demo-webrtc-videoroom_advanced.membraneframework.org.
It will show (in the future) how to implement a little more advanced logic e.g. screensharing or toggling audio and video.
